<p>Pets first has been awesome both to me and my animals on every single visit and in between. Pavlov’s dog &amp; cat hospital was opened in 1993 with dedicated hearts to serve clients and their pets with the highest standard of medicine at affordable prices. When i called pets first, they said to come in right away which is what i needed. The place is very nice with an open feel, very clean and no dog smells.
