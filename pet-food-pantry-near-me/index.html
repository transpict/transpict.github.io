<p>Sponsoring a food drive can be easy and fun! Cny spca’s pet food pantry was created to help members of our community who are having trouble taking care of their pets. The pet food pantry relies on support from the community to help collect food to support our mission. We recommend you contact local shelters or local community groups to also see what other/new initiatives are being offered. Pet food pantries and food banks provide pet food for pet owners who cannot afford it on their own. The vet sent us this this morning . I cant wait to pick up.</p>
