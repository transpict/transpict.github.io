<p>They can be a comforting reminder of a beloved pet. Always make sure the identification label stays with the pet, is attached to the machine when cremating and stays with the ashes. A mans best friend is a fitting tribute to your fallen canine companion. Always make sure the cremation chamber and ashes processors are cleaned thoroughly to collect all the remains before the next cremation or ashes preparation begins. Over time the ashes will ingrate into the soil, the more thinly spread and closer to the surface they are, the faster this will happen. Bull Terrier Cremation Urn for Dog�s ashes, Unique Pet.</p>

This means there is no way to seperate the ashes and they are usually scattered in a communal area. You can buy biodegradable urns that will float off and then later sink in a body of water, and ultimately spread their ashes with the current of the water.
