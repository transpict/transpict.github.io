<p>If you are really considering getting a puppy, please adopt. You can act dumb and see if they give you good advice so you can kind of gauge their expertise. As i would for any bird i have. We went to petsmart to pick up a bird i told them which one i wanted and he let me hold it he said it was young and would live for a couple years he gave me a polisie saying i had 30 days blah blah blah i made sure it had water and food and all that an 9 days later. I always hear about how bad it is to buy birds from petsmart because you are supporting bird mills, but i have no where else to get a diamond dove from (except paying 75 dollars to have one shipped to me from a breeder that lives states away, and i can�t afford that).
