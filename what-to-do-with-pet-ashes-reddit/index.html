<p>But probably the most interesting is turning ashes into diamonds. This website my pet ashes is dedicated to april and i don’t want anyone to go through what we had to so i write a blog about what to think about if you lose a pet, how to cope with pet bereavement and how to celebrate the life they lived. Your vet should be able to help you make a decision based on what you want. When you lose a pet it can be a such a devastating loss that it can be difficult to work out what is the right thing to do, should you leave the ashes at the pet crematorium? And i had a previous dogs ashes made into a paperweight. Pin by My Animal on Awww Animals&amp;Babies Cat day.</p>
