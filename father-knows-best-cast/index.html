<p>If you were to come up with a Classic TV sitcom that embodied 1950s American family values not necessarily life as it was but as many imagined it you could probably start and stop with Father. However when CBS took over the series they cast Elinor Donahue as Betty Billy Gray as Bud Lauren Chapin as Kathy and Jane Wyatt as Margaret Anderson. The three had also played brothers in another ABC sitcom Family Affair. When the pilot first aired as Keep It in the Family the cast consisted of Gordon Gerbert Tina Thompson Ellen Drew and Sally Fraser. This cast list of actors from Father Knows Best focuses primarily on the main characters but there may be a few actors who played smaller roles on Father Knows Best that are on here as well.
