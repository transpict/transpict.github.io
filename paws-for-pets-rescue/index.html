<p>Lovable paws has the greatest dogs available for adoption. All money raised goes towards vet and housing costs. We are a 501(c)(3) non profit animal rescue based in chinook, montana. Our foster program allows us to rescue more animals, and it also gives us the opportunity to better socialize and learn about the pets in our care before they go up for adoption. We allow walk ins, but we are limiting the number of people in the store at one time and following all of the covid guidelines. Whitley Jane Paws rescue, Senior dog, Old dogs.</p>
