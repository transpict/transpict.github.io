Most pet crematories and funeral homes make arrangements for picking up your pet from your home or veterinary hospital, cremating it, and returning the remains to you (along with the identification tag) within a few days. I politely demurred on that one. Many people choose it because it is more environmentally friendly and cost effective. Pin on Saving Pets Lives &amp; Unbreaking Hearts.</p>

<p>After a pet owner leaves, the pet is often bagged in a black garbage bag. Whether you get your pet’s ashes back depends on the type of pet crematorium and cremation service you choose. At pets in peace, we guarantee individual cremation, and that the ashes you receive from us are those of your pet. For most pet owners, we understand that you may face difficulties in making decision about cremating your pet. The veterinarian usually will place the pet into the container and carry the deceased pet out to the car for the owner. Investigation highlights just how little we know about.</p>
